## üîß What Ghostwriter Does

If there are key phrases or compliance notes that must be included, you can enter them in the sidebar.

### 4. **Provide Product Info**

Choose to either:

### 5. **Click 'Generate Draft'**

Ghostwriter sends your input to the AI, and returns a clean draft formatted in Markdown.

## üì§ Exporting Options
